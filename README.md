# json-xml
The CSV file format would be easiest for human eyes, because it is organized visually in a table structure. Furthermore, Excel accepts CSV files and therefore humans can work with CSV files with Excel. Whereas JSON, is easiest for machines to work with because it is more lightweight than XML. JSON is also more versatile than CSV, because it is not limited to the set structure of rows and columns, leaving null values. With JSON's syntax, data can be represented in any particular order and columns are declared at the level of each value:key pairing, rather than at a high level. This also allows JSON to better represent hierarchical data than CSV files.
